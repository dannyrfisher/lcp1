    <h1>3. Past Land Use </h1>

    <h2>3.1 Historical Development</h2>

    <p>Historical Ordnance Survey (OS) map extracts have been examined to provide a summary of significant land use on
      and in proximity to the site, including industrial features and potential landfills within 250m.</p>
    <p>Where available,

      other information such as recent aerial photographs have also been reviewed for evidence of relevant land use.
    <p>Potentially significant features are summarised below, grouped into tables for on-site and off-site features.
      Where more than one instance of the same use occurs in the same direction, only the closest or otherwise most
      significant may be described.</p>

    <div class="captbl">Table 3.1.1: On-Site Historical Features</div>
    <div class="dpTable">
      <script type="text/javascript" src="https://c0hbr589.caspio.com/dp/623e9000587e5ea1b73b4a2eb09f/emb"></script>

    <h2>3.2 Landfill & Waste Sites</h2>
    <p>Documented landfills and other potentially significant waste sites identified within 250m of the site are
      reviewed in table below.</p>

    <div class="captbl">Table 3.2.1: Landfill & Waste Site Records</div>

    <h2>3.3 Industrial Features & Records</h2>

    <p>Industrial features indicating an increased likelihood of the presence of contamination,
      pollution incidents, and sites determined as contaminated land by a statutory authority, within 250m, are reviewed
      in table below. </p>

    <h1>5. Initial Conceptual Site Model </h1>
    <p>For a conceptual risk of harm to human health or the environment to exist within the context of LCRM,
      all of the following elements must be present:
    <ul>
      <li>a source – i.e., a substance (contaminant(s)) that is capable of causing pollution or adverse health effects
      </li>
      <li>a receptor - i.e., something which could be adversely affected by the source </li>
      <li>a pathway – i.e., a route by which the contaminant could come into contact with, or affect, the receptor </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of these identified in relation to the study site is noted below in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.
    </p>

    <p>Key contaminants identified 5.1 also determine the relevant pathways that may be active in 5.3.</p>

    <p>Information on these three elements is used to form an initial conceptual site model (CSM) and identify
      potentially significant contaminant linkages.</p>

    <h2>5.1 Potential Sources of Contamination</h2>
    <p>Any activities or features taking place on the site and identified as potential sources of significant
      contamination are noted in the tables below. </p>
