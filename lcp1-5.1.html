  <h1> 5. Initial Conceptual Site Model </h1>

  <p>For a conceptual risk of harm to human health or the environment to exist within the context of LCRM, all of the
    following elements must be present:
  <ul>
    <li>a source – i.e., a substance (contaminant(s)) that is capable of causing pollution or adverse health effects
    </li>
    <li>a receptor - i.e., something which could be adversely affected by the source </li>
    <li>a pathway – i.e., a route by which the contaminant could come into contact with, or affect, the receptor </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each of these identified in relation to the study site is noted below in Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 respectively.
  </p>

  <p>Key contaminants identified 5.1 also determine the relevant pathways that may be active in 5.3.</p>

  <p>Information on these three elements is used to form an initial conceptual site model (CSM) and identify potentially
    significant contaminant linkages.</p>

    <h2>5.1 Potential Sources of Contamination</h2>

<p>Any activities or features taking place on the site and identified as potential sources of significant contamination are noted in the tables below.					</p>
